Jogging Questions:

1. Function "lamTuple" -
   How to store tuple pair using codePtr (builtin? pprint?) 
   How to pass in the (label, arity) pair as a single [Arg] into tupleWrites?
   Do we tuple-ize in lamTuple or modify tupleWrites to make it work?

2. Quick Check -
   Do we need to implement wellFormedE/D ...seems wellFormed already handles it?

3. Decl Type, How to use AEXP (No longer have nice "Decl") 
   How to extract necessary info from AEXP,etc types ... ex, 
   How to extract f, xs, e, ... (that was previously provided in the Decl Data 
       constructor?
   Can we create a data constructor for type AEXp?
   If no, are we suppose to rely on exbrBinds to deconstruct for us (but what 
   if function/whatever is not in ANF form...?)

4. compileDecl? How to implement? Do we need to?

4. Note,
   Arity check implemented, but forgot about closure check...will need to do that

5. Do we neeed a assertCloseur?

5. How to implement freeVars?
