Jogging Questions: Brain Kaputt atm ... Noting so I can remember these q tomorrow

1. lamTuple - How to store tuple pair using codePtr (builtin? pprint?) and how
   do pass in the (label, arity) pair as a single [Arg] into tupleWrites? ...
   Do we tuple-ize in lamTuple or modify tupleWrites to make it work?

2. Do we need to implement wellFormedE/D ...seems wellFormed already handles it?

3. No longer have nice "Decl" ... how to extract necessary info from AEXP,etc
   types ... ex, how to extract f, xs, e, ... (that was previously provided in
   the Decl Data constructor ... If no more, are we suppose to rely on exbrBinds
   to deconstruct for us (but what if function/whatever is not in ANF form...?)

4. compileDecl??

4. Arity check implemented, but forgot about closure check...will need to do that

5. Do we neeed a assertClosuer?

5. How to implement freeVars?

**main q about missing Decl data construct --> AEXp .../Extraction
